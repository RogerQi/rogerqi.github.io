Ri-Zhao (Roger) Qiu is a first-year research MS student
at the Computer Science Department of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he is co-advised
by Prof. Kris Hauser and Prof. Yuxiong Wang. He is
interested in creating robotics perception algorithms
(segmentation and SLAM) specialized for indoor environments
to help solve fundamental challenges in creating embodied
robot agents.

Prior to his Master’s study, he received his bachelor’s
degree from UIUC with highest distinction in Statistics
and Computer Science and highest distinction in Mathematics.
He worked as a computer vision engineering intern at Megvii
Research Nanjing in 2019, where he was advised by
Prof. Xiu-Shen Wei to develop Auto Augmentation algorithms
as a part of an AutoML software stack. In 2020, he was a
participant in the Illinois CS REU program, where he
worked with Prof. Kris Hauser to develop perception
algorithms for disinfection robotics to help fight the
COVID-19 pandemic.
